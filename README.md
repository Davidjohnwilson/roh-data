# `rohdata` - Python module to analyze public Royal Opera House data
 
## David John Wilson

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Davidjohnwilson/roh-data.svg?branch=development)](https://travis-ci.org/Davidjohnwilson/roh-data)

This module is intended to allow users to pull and analyze data from the Royal Opera House's public archives.

Note, this module will be fairly basic and has been created mainly for my own use. I've done a couple of investigations of ROH data in the past and when I decided to revisit this work I am taking the opportunity to clean up my code and (hopefully!) improve it.

I am currently working on building this package out. The latest stable version will be in the `development` branch and the aim will be for full documentation and test coverage (the travis-ci status of this branch will be shown in the badge above). The original code (which was in a sort of pseudo-package that included some scripts and visualization) will be kept in the `master` branch for now and can be found in the `old-work` directory.
